#Stylease 0.1.0

Use the following gradle tasks to build:

	war
	bootRepackage
	
This will produce an executable WAR(Web Application aRchive),
which can be ran using the following command:

	java -jar Stylease-0.1.0.war
	
I included the .class files so you are aware of proper 
directory structure. I used eclipse along with the Gradle
plugin to build, but command line gradle will work as well.
